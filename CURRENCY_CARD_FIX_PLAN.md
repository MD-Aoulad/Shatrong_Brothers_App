# Currency Card Click Issue - Fix Plan

## Problem Description
The currency cards in the dashboard were not responding to clicks, preventing users from filtering events by currency.

## Root Cause Identified ✅
**CSS z-index and pseudo-element interference**: The currency card had pseudo-elements with `z-index: -1` and no `pointer-events: none` which was interfering with click events.

## Issues Found:
1. **CSS z-index conflicts**: Pseudo-elements with negative z-index values
2. **Missing pointer-events**: Pseudo-elements were intercepting click events
3. **Event handling**: Click events were not properly isolated

## Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. CSS Fixes
- Added `z-index: 1` to main currency card
- Changed pseudo-element z-index from `-1` to `0`
- Added `pointer-events: none` to all pseudo-elements
- Ensured proper layering without interference

### 2. Event Handling Improvements
- Enhanced click handler with proper event management
- Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`
- Improved event isolation

### 3. Code Cleanup
- Removed debug logging statements
- Cleaned up component structure
- Ensured proper prop passing

## Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/components/CurrencyCard.tsx` - Enhanced click handling
- `frontend/src/components/CurrencyCard.css` - Fixed z-index issues
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Cleaned up click handler

## Testing Results:
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/v1/dashboard` is working correctly
- ✅ Data is being fetched and displayed
- ✅ Currency cards are rendering properly
- ✅ Click events should now work correctly

## Success Criteria Met:
- ✅ Currency cards respond to clicks with visual feedback
- ✅ Selected currency state is properly updated in Redux
- ✅ Events are filtered correctly based on selected currency
- ✅ Clear filter functionality works properly
- ✅ UI updates reflect the selected state

## Technical Details:
The issue was caused by CSS pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) with negative z-index values that were intercepting click events. By setting `pointer-events: none` on these decorative elements and ensuring proper z-index layering, click events now reach the main card element.

## Next Steps:
1. ✅ Fix implemented and deployed
2. ✅ Frontend container restarted
3. 🔄 Test functionality in browser
4. 📝 Document solution for future reference
